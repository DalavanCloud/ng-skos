<p>Welcome to angular-skos API reference.</p>
<p>ng-skos is an AngularJS module to work with terminologies, based on the 
Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS). In short, the module supports 
<b>concepts</b> (based on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/#secconcept">SKOS Concept</a>), 
<b>terminologies</b> (based on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/#secscheme">SKOS Concept Schemes</a>),
and <b>mappings</b> (based on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#mapping">SKOS mapping properties</a>).
Concept collections for grouping and sorting concepts are not supported yet. </p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/"><a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/</a></a> for more information about SKOS.</p>
<h3 id="ng-skos---api-reference_concepts">Concepts</h3>
<p>A <b>concept</b> in ng-skos is a JSON object with the following keys:</p>
<dl>
<dt>uri
<dd>URI of the concept, 
    given as string
<dt>prefLabel
<dd>object that maps language tags to preferred labels,
    each given as string
<dt>altLabel
<dd>object that maps language tags to unordered arrays of alternative labels,
    each given as string
<dt>notation
<dd>partly ordered array of notations, 
    each given as string. The first notation might be used as primary 
    notation but multiple notations might also be used equivalently. The data
    type is assumed to be undefined or implicitly known. To support multiple 
    notations of different type, additional concept keys might be introduced
    in a later version of ng-skos.
<dt>narrower
<dd>...
<dt>broader
<dd>...
<dt>related
<dd>...
<dt>ancestors
<dd>...
<dt>inScheme
<dd>unordered array of terminologies,
    each given either as string with the URI of the terminology, or as
    terminology object.
</dl>

<h3 id="ng-skos---api-reference_terminologies">Terminologies</h3>
<p>A <b>terminology</b> in ng-skos is a JSON object with the following keys:
*</p>
<dl>
<dt>uri
<dd>URI of the terminology
<dt>prefLabel
<dd>an object that maps language tags to preferred names of the terminology,
    each given as string.
<dt>altLabel
<dd>...
<dt>notation
<dd>... (e.g. acronym)
<dt>topConcepts
<dd>unordered array of strings with concept URIs and/or concept objects.
</dl>

<h3 id="ng-skos---api-reference_mappings">Mappings</h3>
<p>A <b>mapping</b> in ng-skos is a JSON object with keys yet-to-be defined.</p>
<p>All keys are optional, but an empty object should better be replaced by </p>
<p><tt>null</tt>. Missing keys may indicate that the corresponding properties
is not known (open world). To explicitly state for instance that a concept 
has no notation (closed world), set it no <tt>null</tt> or to an empty array.</p>
<p>See also <a href="#/api/ng-skos.skosAccess">ng-skos.skosAccess</a> to look up concepts and terminologies by URI </p>
