# How entities are expressed

The core entities supported by ng-skos are JSON objects that encode:

<dl>
<dt>{@link concepts}</dt>
<dd>based on {@link http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/#secconcept SKOS Concepts}
<dt>{@link terminologies}</dt>
<dd>based on {@link
http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/#secscheme SKOS Concept Schemes}</dd>
<dt>{@link mappings}</dt>
<dd>based on {@link http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#mapping
SKOS mapping properties}</dd>
</dl>

Concept collections for grouping and sorted concepts are not supported yet.

All object keys are optional, but an empty object should better be replaced by
`null`. Missing keys may indicate that the corresponding properties is
not known (open world). To explicitly state for instance that a concept has no
notation (closed world), set it no <tt>null</tt> or to an empty array.
